    <!-- <p class="h2 hdcol">Facts about dogs</p> -->
  <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal ms-5 me-5 brief" align="center">Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. 
    They influence social, emotional, and cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle,
    provide companionship, and have even been able to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of
   certain cancers. Dogs can also help to relieve stress and anxiety in people. Around 38% of US householdsare 
   estimated to have one or more dogs. Although dogs can be beneficial to the health and wellbeing of their owners,
   people should be aware that dogs of any age, including puppies, can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make
   people sick. Germs from dogs can cause a variety of illnesses, from minor skin infections to serious illnesses. 
   One of the best ways you can protect yourself from getting sick is to thoroughly wash your hands after handling,
   caring for, feeding, or cleaning up after dogs. By providing your dog with routine veterinary care and 
   following Healthy tips, you are less likely to get sick from touching or interacting with a dog.</p>

      However, it will be better for your future furry BFF if you put a lot of thought into it. For example, 
      do you live in an apartment, or a house with a yard? Does your family travel a lot? Who will be there to 
      let your dog out when you're not home? Do your siblings want a new dog as much as you do?</p>

    <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Even though there are many wonderful dogs waiting in shelters for
      someone to adopt them, breeders and pet stores continue to produce and sell animals just to make money.
       For every dog bought from a pet store or breeder, a dog in a shelter has to be put to sleep.Pet stores
        cause countless dogs (and many other animals) to suffer, so adopt your pup from a shelter instead.</p>

    <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Dogs require a lot of care that can quickly add up to big bucks. When you're
       responsible for a dog, you need to spend money on regular and emergency vet visits (just like humans,
        dogs can have medical emergencies!), bedding, a collar and harness, high-quality dog food, treats, toys,
         grooming...the list goes on</p>

    <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Every year 6 to 8 million animals in the U.S. are left at animal shelters, 
      and half of them are put to sleep just because there aren't enough good homes for them all. Can you imagine 
      if you were killed simply because there wasn't enough room for you in the world? The only way to help stop 
      this is to make sure that no more unwanted puppies are born.</p>

    <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Accidents happen and you never know if and when your dog will get lost or 
      run away. If you couldn't find your way back home, you'd be able to call someone for help, but that's not
       the case with dogs. Get a collar with proper tags that have your dog's name and at least two phone numbers 
       for you or your family. Microchipping (a simple procedure that the vet can do) is another great way to make
        sure your dog gets back home again! If you move, make sure you update the tags and give the microchip 
        company your new information. Ask your parents to talk to your dog's vet for more information.</p>

    <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Dogs' nails should be trimmed regularly so that they don't break, get snagged on something (which can hurt!), or get so long that they interfere with normal walking—if dogs' nails grow too long, it can affect their gait and even their nervous system. Some dogs hate having their paws handled, but you can always take your pup to the vet or groomer once a month and let them handle it!</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Brushing dogs regularly helps prevent nasty matting and increases circulation to the skin—which keeps it healthy! Spending that quality time together can also be a nice bonding experience. Some pups need professional grooming, so sit down with your parents and read up on how much upkeep your new friend's coat will need. Dogs don't really need baths very often. It's only necessary if they have a skin condition or if they roll in something smelly or dirty, so don't go overboard with the shampoo—it can dry out their skin and remove important natural oils if used too often.</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Some foods that are fine for people to eat can be poisonous to dogs. High up on the list is chocolate—but that's not all. There're lots of “human foods” that could also be harmful—like onions, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, and more. It's also important to feed your pup high-quality dog food and treats, and be careful not to overfeed—obesity (being super overweight) causes major health problems in dogs and makes them very uncomfortable. And regular meals are much healthier than leaving food out all day long.</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Before adopting a dog, it's important to pup-proof your home. Hide dangerous items such as chemicals, electrical wiring, and sharp objects—ask your parents to help you find good places for these things. But also, put away anything that could be viewed by your new dog as a toy. If you don't want your homework or favorite pillow chewed up, be sure to keep them out of your furry friend's reach. Leave plenty of dog-friendly chew toys out—you don't like being bored, and neither will your furry BFF!</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">This one might seem like a no-brainer because of course pups need to run around. But sometimes people don't realize just how much exercise their new pooch will really need.Dogs need to go on at least one long walk every single day. Play games like fetch or “hide and seek” with your furry BFF when you get home from school to help release some of that wild doggie energy. Plenty of exercise and fresh air makes for a happy pup and, as they say, “A tired dog is a well-behaved dog.”</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">This is a big one. The key to having a happy dog is setting clear rules and boundaries. It's important to guide new pups with positive rewards. They'll repeat good behavior if they're praised for it—just like human kiddos! J And don't ever lock them in a crate or yell at them for “misbehaving”—that will just make them afraid of you. Dogs can't possibly know how you want them to behave until you and your family teach them.</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">This is especially important from late spring into the fall, when these little critters are the most common. Ask your parents to purchase products that keep fleas and ticks off your dog (such as Comfortis) from your vet.
    
          And don't forget about heartworms! Where there are mosquitos in the U.S., you can usually find heartworms—and heartworm disease can kill dogs. Thankfully, heartworm prevention is as simple as giving your dog a monthly medication, such as Heartgard (also available from your vet!).</p>

        <p class="para1 h5 fw-normal">Temperatures inside cars can skyrocket in a matter of minutes—even if it's not particularly hot outside. If you see a dog locked inside a hot car, ask your parents to report it to the police or animal control immediately. You could save a life!</p>
